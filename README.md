### Array flatten implementations in JavaScript

This repository is dedicated to different implementations
of array flatten in ES2015.

The motivation is to explore the differences between imperative
ant functional ways to implement array flattening algorithms.

Currently you might check out the following implementations:
- for loop
- Array.prototype.forEach
- Array.prototype.map
- Array.prototype.reduce

#### To run tests:

```sh
$ npm i
$ npm test
```

#### Todo:
- while loop
- Cover all examples with tests
